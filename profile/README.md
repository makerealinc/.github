# Make Real, Inc.

Welcome to the GitHub organization for Make Real, Inc.! We are a company dedicated to creating cutting-edge tech-based entertainment experiences that range from thrilling escape rooms to captivating outdoor activities. Our focus is on delivering unique and unforgettable adventures that leverage the power of technology to provide our guests with one-of-a-kind encounters.

## Our Mission

At Make Real, Inc., our mission is two-fold. We are a profit-driven organization, but above all, we are passionate about crafting exceptional and immersive experiences for our guests. We believe that technology is the key to unlocking new possibilities and pushing the boundaries of traditional entertainment attractions. By embracing the latest advancements, we strive to astonish and delight our visitors, leaving them with lasting memories and a desire for more.

## The Bureau Adventure Games

Our flagship venue, "The Bureau Adventure Games," is a testament to our commitment to tech-driven experiences. At this location, guests can explore an array of escape rooms, each with its own captivating theme. From sci-fi adventures to spine-chilling horror, we offer a diverse selection of games that challenge the boundaries of what is possible within an escape room setting.

In "The Bureau," technology plays a central role in enhancing the immersion and intrigue. Guests will encounter interactive puzzles that require "hacking" into virtual systems, using custom-built electronics, and discovering seemingly impossible interactions that turn the ordinary into the extraordinary.

## Expanding Horizons

While our current focus remains on the "Bureau" locations and continuously creating new escape room experiences, we eagerly anticipate the future. Make Real, Inc. has a grand vision of extending its expertise to include a broader range of entertainment offerings. Our plans include venturing into outdoor attractions like scavenger hunts, as well as curating pop-up experiences for special events.

## Experimentation and Innovation

In the pursuit of delivering unique and captivating entertainment, we embrace experimentation and innovation. Our technology stack is diverse, ranging from standard technology such as Unity and JavaScript for some experiences to the creation of custom electronics using Python and Arduino. This experimental approach allows us to constantly push the boundaries and create experiences that surprise and delight our guests.
